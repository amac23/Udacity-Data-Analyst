## Courses and Projects:
---

### Descriptive Statistics
* Learn to use descriptive statistics to describe properties of datasets and learn about how samples and populations are related.
  
### Intro to Data Analysis
* Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.
* *Project 1:* [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/amac23/Udacity-Data-Analyst/tree/master/P1%20-%20Investigate%20a%20Dataset)

### Data Wrangling
* Choose a region of the world from www.openstreetmap.org and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.
* *Project 2:* [Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/amac23/Udacity-Data-Analyst/tree/master/P2%20-%20Wrangle%20OpenStreetMap%20Data)

### Exploratory Data Analysis
* Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.
* *Project 3:* [Explore and Summarize Data](https://github.com/amac23/Udacity-Data-Analyst/tree/master/P3%20-%20Explore%20and%20Summarize%20Data)

### Inferential Statistics
